# Mail me

This is a GitHub repository for a web page named “Mail”. It provides a private contact form for users to send emails. The page uses a question-based verification system instead of a traditional CAPTCHA to deter spam. The questions are randomly selected and change when the user switches tabs or reloads the page. The system has limitations and may need stronger alternatives for significant spam or automated attacks.

It is important to consider the limitations of this solution and assess the level of security required for the specific application. In case of significant spam or automated attacks, it might be advisable to explore stronger CAPTCHA alternatives.
